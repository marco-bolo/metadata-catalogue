# Software Templates  

This repository provides templates for various types of software, defined using schema.org's vocabulary:  

- Service  
- Software Source Code  
- Software Application  
- Web Application  

These templates outline both software types and their respective fields, offering a structured approach to metadata representation. For detailed information on each field, including definitions, usage examples, and expected data types, refer to [Schema.org](https://schema.org/).  

The listed properties provide a comprehensive overview of all possible fields. However, specific use cases will require only a subset of these fields, selected based on relevance to the given context.  

These templates serve as a flexible foundation, allowing customization while maintaining consistency with schema.org standards. By leveraging schema.orgâ€™s structured vocabulary, the metadata remains interoperable and machine-readable, ensuring compatibility with other metadata standards and systems.
