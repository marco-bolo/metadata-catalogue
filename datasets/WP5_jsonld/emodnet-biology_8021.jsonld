    "description": "The UK Marine Recorder public snapshot is an aggregated UK-wide marine dataset, published on a 6monthly basis. Data are collated by JNCC from publicly accessible data provided to JNCC by UK governmental and non-governmental conservation bodies from data holdings within each organisation’s internal “Marine Recorder” marine data management database application. Marine Recorder is a benthic survey data management system used widely within the UK’s statutory nature conservation bodies to store and query benthic sample data across the UK’s offshore and inshore waters. The system is able to store species occurrence data (with associated measurements), biotope information in the Marine Habitat Classification for Britain &amp; Ireland and physical attribute data. The system maintains consistency and relationships between sample information, measurements and surveys allowing for accessible querying of the database. Contributors to the snapshot are: Centre for Environmental Data and Recording (CEDaR, Northern Ireland); Data Archive for Seabed Species and Habitats (DASSH); Joint Nature Conservation Committee; Natural England; Natural Resources Wales; Porcupine Marine Natural History Society; Scottish Natural Heritage; Seasearch (Marine Conservation Society); Shoresearch Kent Wildlife Trust and The Wildlife Trusts.",
