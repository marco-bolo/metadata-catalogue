Among other tasks, in 2005 the &#34;Coastline Quality Network of Cantabria&#34; was launched, within which an analysis of the quality of water, sediments and certain biological indicators is carried out, in the transitional and coastal water masses of Cantabria. The methodology used to cell counting was Utermohl method (Utermohl, 1958).
